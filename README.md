bytebeat
========

Based on the idea described on
[http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat/](http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat/)
and includes tools for easy experimentation.  "Bytebeat" refers to sound
generated by simple formulas sent to an audio output.

  + clive lets you play different tunes grabbed from the site.
  + byteplay lets you play an arbitrary formula (use 't' for the current step;
    see the formulas in 'clive.c' for inspiration).
  + bibgen poorly generates a tune and plays it.
  + exprgen generates a formula, but isn't very good either.


Installation
------------

These tools depend on libtcc to dynamically generate C code for execution;
download from [http://bellard.org/tcc/](http://bellard.org/tcc/).

Just run `make` afterwards.  Should work on at least some platforms.

Bugs and the like
-----------------

Needs documentation.  Does some non-standard C things (don't compile with
-pedantic).  Would be nice with a better random tune generator.
